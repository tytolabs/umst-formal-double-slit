(** Extraction configuration.

    [ExtrOcamlBasic] maps Coq's basic types to efficient OCaml types:
      • [bool]  →  OCaml [bool]  (not the inductive encoding)
      • [nat]   →  OCaml [int]   (for small naturals)
      • [list]  →  OCaml [list]

    [ExtrOcamlString] maps Coq strings to OCaml native strings.

    These mappings ensure the extracted code is idiomatic OCaml
    rather than a naive transliteration of inductive types. *)

(** We also configure extraction of Q (rationals).
    By default, Q extracts to a pair (Z, positive) with arithmetic
    defined inductively.  This is correct but not performant.
    For a production system, one would map Q to OCaml's Zarith
    library.  For our purposes — reference testing against Rust —
    correctness matters more than speed. *)

(** Extract [gate_check] and all its dependencies to a single file.
    This produces:
      gate_extracted.ml   — OCaml implementation
      gate_extracted.mli  — OCaml interface

    The extraction recursively pulls in:
      • [ThermodynamicState] record  →  OCaml record type
      • [gate_check]                 →  OCaml function bool
      • [Qle_bool], [Qminus], etc.  →  rational arithmetic helpers
      • [delta_mass], [Q_hyd]        →  rational constants

    Proofs ([admissible], [gate_check_correct], etc.) are erased
    because they live in Prop — zero runtime overhead. *)

(* Coq 8.18 (apt): [Set Extraction Output Directory] is not a valid option — removed.
   Use a path in [Extraction] below; [coq-check] ensures [_extract/] exists. *)

(*  After running [coqc Extraction.v], compile the extracted code from [Coq/_extract/]:

      # Option A: bytecode (quick, for testing)
      ocamlfind ocamlc -package zarith -linkpkg _extract/gate_extracted.ml \
        -o gate_test

      # Option B: native (optimised, for benchmarking)
      ocamlfind ocamlopt -package zarith -linkpkg _extract/gate_extracted.ml \
        -o gate_test

    Note: the extracted code uses Coq's own integer representations
    (binary positive, Z as [Z0 | Zpos p | Zneg p]).  If you want to
    use zarith's efficient integers, define extraction mappings:

      Extract Inductive positive => "int" ["..."] "...".
      Extract Inductive Z => "int" ["0" "..." "..."] "...".

    For the reference-testing use case, the default extraction is
    sufficient — we care about logical correctness, not speed.        *)

(*  The validation workflow:

    1. Generate test vectors (random ThermodynamicState pairs)
       — use QuickCheck in Haskell, or a Python script, or Rust's
         proptest crate

    2. Run each test vector through:
       (a) The extracted OCaml [gate_check] function
       (b) The Rust kernel's [ThermodynamicFilter::check_transition]

    3. Assert identical accept/reject decisions on every vector.

    Any discrepancy is a BUG IN THE RUST KERNEL (or in the test
    harness), because the OCaml code is extracted from a verified
    Coq proof and is correct by construction.

    The Haskell layer (UMST.hs + FFI.hs) already implements this
    comparison via QuickCheck property tests.  The extracted OCaml
    provides a THIRD independent implementation for added confidence.

    This three-way comparison (Coq/OCaml, Haskell, Rust) is the
    gold standard for safety-critical verified software.              *)
