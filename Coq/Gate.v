(** A [ThermodynamicState] captures the minimal set of fields needed
    to evaluate the four physical invariants.  We use rationals [Q]

    f64 with tolerance ε = 10⁻⁶; here we prove properties exactly.

(** Tolerance for the mass conservation check.
    In the Rust kernel this is 100.0 kg/m³ — a generous bound that
    catches gross density jumps (e.g., accidentally swapping concrete
    with timber) while allowing normal hydration-induced changes
    (cement paste densifies by ~5–8% during full hydration). *)

Definition delta_mass : Q := 100 # 1.

(** Heat of hydration constant.
    Q_hyd ≈ 450 J/g for typical Portland cement (CEM I).
    The Helmholtz free energy model is ψ(α) = −Q_hyd · α.
    Since Q_hyd > 0, advancing hydration (α ↑) decreases ψ (ψ ↓),
    encoding the irreversible exothermic nature of the reaction.

    This value is consistent with standard Portland cement calorimetry
    data (Mindess, Young & Darwin, 2003) and the UMST Rust kernel. *)

        ψ(α) = −Q_hyd · α

    This is a simplification of the full thermodynamic potential
    (which would include elastic strain energy, thermal terms, etc.)
    but captures the dominant effect: hydration releases stored
    chemical energy monotonically.

    Physical intuition: think of unhydrated cement grains as tiny
    batteries.  Each grain that reacts (increasing α) discharges
    energy (decreasing ψ).  You cannot un-react a grain, so α only
    goes up and ψ only goes down. *)

    [admissible old new_] holds iff the transition old → new_
    satisfies all four physical laws simultaneously.

    Categorically, this defines the admissible morphisms in the
    category of material states — only transitions satisfying all
    four constraints are physically realisable.  The gate is the
    characteristic function of this predicate.

    Note on dt:  The time step appears in the Rust kernel's
    computation of ψ̇ = (ψ_new − ψ_old) / dt, but cancels in the
    sign check:
        D_int ≥ 0  ⟺  −ρ · ψ̇ ≥ 0  ⟺  ψ̇ ≤ 0  (since ρ > 0)
    We therefore omit dt without loss of generality. *)

                                   = ρ · (ψ_old − ψ_new)

(*  SECTION 7: Physical Model Axioms                                    *)
(* ================================================================== *)

(** These axioms encode constitutive relationships from cement
    chemistry and continuum mechanics.  They are NOT arbitrary
    assumptions — they follow from the underlying physics:

    - The Helmholtz model ψ(α) = −Q_hyd · α is exothermic, so
      advancing hydration (α ↑) decreases free energy (ψ ↓).
    - The Powers model fc = S · x³ (gel-space ratio) is monotone
      in hydration degree at fixed water/cement ratio.

    In the Agda layer these appear as [postulate]; here they serve
    the same role.  A fully constructive proof would require
    embedding the arithmetic of each specific constitutive law.

    These axioms are consistent — they do not introduce logical
    paradoxes.  They assert physical properties that are well-
    established in the cement science literature and corroborated
    by field observation (see Docs/Architecture-Invariants.md). *)

(** Axiom (Helmholtz Model):  Free energy is antitone in hydration.
    If α₁ ≤ α₂ then ψ(α₂) ≤ ψ(α₁).

    Physically: advancing hydration releases heat, lowering the
    Helmholtz free energy.  This is the essence of the second law
    applied to cement hydration — the reaction proceeds because it
    is thermodynamically favourable (free energy decreasing). *)

Axiom psi_antitone : forall s1 s2 : ThermodynamicState,
  hydration s1 <= hydration s2 ->
  free_energy s2 <= free_energy s1.

(** Axiom (Powers Model):  Strength is monotone in hydration.
    If α₁ ≤ α₂ then fc(α₁) ≤ fc(α₂).

    Physically: continued hydration fills gel pores with C-S-H gel,
    increasing the gel-space ratio x, and since fc = S · x³ (where
    S ≈ 234 MPa for Portland cement), strength grows monotonically.

    This holds for undamaged material at fixed w/c.  Damage mechanics
    (cracking, sulfate attack, etc.) would require extending the
    model, but that is outside the scope of the UMST gate. *)

    for the [psi_antitone] axiom.

    Proof obligation: if a₁ ≤ a₂ and Q > 0, then −Q·a₂ ≤ −Q·a₁.
    This is a standard ordered-field property: multiplying both sides
    of an inequality by a negative number (−Q < 0) reverses the
    direction. *)

(*  SECTION 8b: Helmholtz Gradient — SDF Interpretation                *)
(* ================================================================== *)

(** Lemma (Helmholtz Gradient):
    The discrete gradient of the Helmholtz function is constant:

        ψ(α + ε) − ψ(α) = −Q_hyd · ε

    This is the formal counterpart of the SDF "Eikonal" condition:
    the gradient of ψ has constant magnitude Q_hyd = 450 J/kg
    everywhere on [0, 1].  Specifically:

        ψ(α) = −Q_hyd · α
        ψ(α + ε) = −Q_hyd · (α + ε) = −Q_hyd · α − Q_hyd · ε
        ψ(α + ε) − ψ(α) = −Q_hyd · ε

    This, together with helmholtz_antitone, gives the complete SDF
    characterisation of ψ:
      • Gradient direction: −Q_hyd < 0 (antitone in α, §8)
      • Gradient magnitude: Q_hyd = 450 (constant, Eikonal, §8b)
      • Admissible side: ψ_new ≤ ψ_old, i.e., moving along −∇ψ

    In the gate's Clausius-Duhem check, the condition D_int ≥ 0 is
    exactly the condition that the state transition moves along the
    negative-gradient direction of ψ.

    Proof: immediate by ring — the goal reduces to linear arithmetic
    over Q after unfolding the definitions. *)

(*  SECTION 9: Theorem — Clausius-Duhem Forward                         *)
(* ================================================================== *)

(** Theorem (Clausius-Duhem Forward):
    If hydration advances (α₂ ≥ α₁) and the Helmholtz model holds
    (free energy is antitone in α), then dissipation is non-negative.

    In our formulation, non-negative dissipation is equivalent to
    ψ_new ≤ ψ_old (since ρ > 0 and dt > 0 cancel out).

    Mathematical derivation:
      ψ(α) = −Q_hyd · α,   Q_hyd = 450 > 0
      α_new ≥ α_old
      ⟹  ψ_new = −Q · α_new ≤ −Q · α_old = ψ_old

                = ρ · (ψ_old − ψ_new) / dt ≥ 0          □

(** Theorem (Strength Monotone — Powers):
    If hydration advances (α₂ ≥ α₁), then compressive strength
    cannot decrease: fc₂ ≥ fc₁.

    This follows from the Powers gel-space ratio model:

        fc = S · x³

    where x = gel-space ratio = (0.68 · α) / (0.32 · α + w/c).
    At fixed w/c ratio, x is monotone increasing in α (more
    hydration → more gel → higher gel-space ratio).  Since x³ is
    monotone increasing for x ≥ 0, fc is monotone in α.

    Field corroboration: cube tests on lime-stabilised earth and RAC
    mixes consistently showed monotone strength gain during curing.
    Strength reversals were observed only under damage conditions
    (freeze-thaw cycling, sulfate attack), which the UMST gate handles
    separately via material-class-specific activation checks. *)

(* ================================================================== *)

(** Theorem 1 (Categorical Safety — Forward Hydration is Admissible):

    If hydration advances (α_new ≥ α_old) and density is conserved
    (|ρ_new − ρ_old| < δ), then the state transition is admissible.

    This is the CORE SAFETY THEOREM.  It says that the physical
    process of cement hydration — as modelled by the Powers /
    Clausius-Duhem framework — can NEVER be rejected by the gate.

    The gate rejects only unphysical transitions:
      • Reverse hydration  (α decreasing — violates chemistry)
      • Spontaneous strength loss  (fc decreasing — violates Powers)
      • Mass violations  (density jumping — violates conservation)
      • Dissipation-violating paths  (ψ increasing — violates 2nd law)

      Given α_new ≥ α_old and |ρ_new − ρ_old| < δ:

        2. ψ_new ≤ ψ_old by [psi_antitone] (Clausius-Duhem)

(* ================================================================== *)

(** Theorem (Gate Correctness):
    [gate_check] returns [true] if and only if [admissible] holds.

    This is a SOUNDNESS + COMPLETENESS result:

    Soundness (→):    gate_check = true  →  admissible
      "If the gate says yes, the transition truly is admissible."
      This ensures the gate never accepts unphysical transitions.

    Completeness (←):  admissible  →  gate_check = true
      "If a transition is admissible, the gate says yes."
      This ensures the gate never rejects valid transitions.

    Together, [gate_check] is the faithful decision procedure for
    [admissible].  The extracted OCaml code inherits this guarantee:
    the boolean function computed by OCaml agrees exactly with the
    mathematical predicate proved correct in Coq.

    Proof strategy:
      We decompose the 5-way boolean conjunction into individual
